The only features we have at our disposal, however, are the name of the first author, the year of publication and the title of the work. We have no direct information about an author's gender. An author's first name, however, allows to guess their gender with relatively high reliability. This is, of course, a simplification that disregards non-binary authors who do not identify with either gender, and it might get the names of transgender people wrong, as well as some names which are used in untypical ways (Hilary Putnam, for instance, is a male philosopher with a first name that is more commonly given to girls). Nonetheless, under the assumption that these errors occur (roughly) equally often for authors categorized as *male* or *female*, the first name will allow us to obtain a relatively accurate estimate of the proportion of female-authored references in the encyclopedia. Yet, it is important to highlight that this does not give us exact numbers, but only an estimate.\n",

Among female philosophers, *Martha Nussbaum* is the most cited, followed by *Christine Korsgaard* and *Julia Annas*. It is striking that the ten most cited male philosophers each have significantly more citations than their female counterpart on the same rank. The female philosopher with the most citations, Martha Nussbaum, has less citations than the ninth most cited male philosopher. This further confirms that there is a strong imbalance between the representation of genders in the SEP."

    "Let us now look at which universities researchers who are cited in the SEP are affiliated with, and how citations are located geographically. To this end, we extract data on researcher affiliations from PhilPeople (http://www.philpeople.org). Unfortunately, only for roughly half the citations was it possible to obtain affiliation data (72140 of 147599, or ~49%). The missing affiliation data might be due to a number of reasons. Historical figures are typically not listed on PhilPeople, as are researchers from fields other than philosophy. Under this assumption, we are not analyzing where citations on the SEP come from in general, but where contemporary philosophy citations come from. This, however, is an interesting question in its own right. All in all, we find that citations come from researchers from 1070 different universities."
